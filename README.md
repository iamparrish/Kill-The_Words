# Kill-The-Words
Kill The Words is a fast-paced reflex game where players must destroy words before they flood the screen. With each level, words appear quicker and in trickier patterns, testing speed, focus, and accuracy. Simple to learn yet tough to master, itâ€™s an addictive challenge of precision and reaction.
